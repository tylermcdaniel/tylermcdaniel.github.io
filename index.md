## About Me
Hello! I am a [__PhD Candidate__](https://sociology.stanford.edu/people/tyler-mcdaniel) in the Department of Sociology at Stanford University. I am also a member of the [__Center for Education Policy Analysis__](https://cepa.stanford.edu/people/tyler-mcdaniel) and the [__Changing Cities Research Lab__](https://ccrl.stanford.edu/team). I mostly work on issues related to segregation, climate change, and schools. My dissertation examines how the changing climate influences spatial inequalities in educational opportunity, through mechanisms such as unequal disruptions to schooling, differential rates of residential or school displacement, and uneven recoveries to natural disasters across places. 

## Research

Much of my research focuses on spatial inequality in the twenty-first century. In [__a review article__](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-soc-030420-014126), Jackelyn Hwang and I discuss scholarship on the persistence of racial residential segregation amidst neighborhood change. We outline three mechanisms that perpetuate these processes: resource inequalities, enduring ethnoracial hierarchies, and consolidated institutional power.

My dissertation considers how climate disasters relate to spatial inequalities in homes and schools. Using statewide student records from North Carolina, and fine-grain flooding information, I look at the impacts of hurricane flooding on student mobility patterns through homes and schools, what these mean for broader patterns of segregation, and how repeated exposure to disasters affects academic progression.

## Teaching
I recently taught a course called [__Analytics for a Changing Climate: Introduction to Social Data Science__](https://bookdown.org/tylermc/soc128d/). Please reach out if you would like to use any course materials or collaborate!

I also regularly teach with the [__Stanford Jail and Prison Education Program__](https://sjpep.weebly.com/).

## Data and Materials

I wrote a helper function for loading Common Core Data from [__NCES' Elementary and Secondary Information System__](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/elsi/). You can find the function [__here__](https://github.com/tylermcdaniel/tidy_elsi).

A replication package for descriptive analyses on metropolitan residential racial segregation between 1980-2020 is available [__here__](https://purl.stanford.edu/sy352sf3635).
