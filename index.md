## About Me
Hello! I am a [PhD Candidate](https://sociology.stanford.edu/people/tyler-mcdaniel) in the Department of Sociology at Stanford University. I am also a member of the [Center for Education Policy Analysis](https://cepa.stanford.edu/people/tyler-mcdaniel) and the [Changing Cities Research Lab](https://ccrl.stanford.edu/team). I mostly work on issues related to segregation, climate change, and schools. My dissertation examines how the changing climate influences spatial inequalities in educational opportunity, through mechanisms such as unequal disruptions to schooling, differential rates of residential or school displacement, and uneven recoveries to natural disasters across places.
