## Bio
I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Sociology at Stanford University. I mostly work on issues related to spatial inequality, climate hazards, and schools. For my dissertation, I focus on my home state of North Carolina to explore how the changing climate influences spatial inequalities in educational opportunity through mechanisms such as unequal disruptions to schooling, differential rates of residential or school displacement, and uneven recoveries to natural disasters across places. I am a member of the [__Center for Education Policy Analysis__](https://cepa.stanford.edu/) and the [__Changing Cities Research Lab__](https://ccrl.stanford.edu/).
